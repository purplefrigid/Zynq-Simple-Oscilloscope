This is a simple oscilloscope implemented using zynq. The development platform is the Black Gold AX7020 development board, and the AD uses ALINK's AD7606 module. Up to 8 waveforms can be displayed simultaneously, and each waveform can also be displayed separately. You can pause waveform changes, adjust waveform amplitude, frequency, and y-coordinate position. Has the ability to record waveforms to move the displayed waveform along the timeline (x-axis)
